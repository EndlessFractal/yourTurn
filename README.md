# About
This is a FoundryVTT module that I decided to adopt for two reasons:
- Lack of updates and issues piling up upstream.
- Learn more about FoundryVTT module development.

I've decided to take matters into my own hands and give something back to the community. 

This project builds upon the [original](https://github.com/Autmor) adding more customization and solving existing bugs.

# Bugs/Glitches/Requests
Just open an issue above. Keep in mind that **not all systems will be supported**.

I'm working on this module on my free time. New features may take long to be implemented.
Feel free to help me out by addressing the existing issues.
I'll do my best to keep the basic functionality working for the foreseeable future.
